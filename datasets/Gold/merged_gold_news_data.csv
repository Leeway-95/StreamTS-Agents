In this context.participants mentioned a range of other indicators that help assess labor market conditions.including: the unemployment rate.the ratio of job openings to unemployed.wage growth.the proportion of unemployed people finding work.the voluntary turnover rate of employed individuals.and the layoff rate. Participants generally agreed that the latest readings of these indicators did not show a sharp deterioration in labor market conditions.

Louis-Vincent Gave.founding partner and CEO of Gavekal Research.stated.The gold bull market has now spread to silver.platinum.and palladium.and even seems to be seeping into copper. Once a precious metals bull market begins.it usually requires factors such as a hawkish stance from the Federal Reserve or a significant appreciation of the dollar to stop it.

Unlike stocks and bonds.metals like silver offer investors a sense of security and promise to protect cash from inflation. Another analyst stated.'If silver prices can remain above $50.it could mean the market is reassessing silver's economic value and its store-of-value function.or simply a repricing of silver at market capitalization.'

Jared Tate.founder of DigiByte: Gold and silver are sending a strong warning about the global economic situation.the world economic order.and the dollar's status as the global reserve currency. This price movement foreshadows a severe economic recession.or even war. 6. Independent analyst Ross Norman: What's unique about the silver market is that its net long positions have only increased moderately.indicating that this rally is not speculative. There is a fairly solid fundamental support behind silver's price fluctuations. 7. Phillip Nova analyst Priyanka Sachdeva: As a more volatile relative of gold.silver has recently outperformed gold in some trades. Historically.silver has tended to amplify gold's movements during upward cycles.and this pattern seems to be repeating itself. 8. Louis-Vincent.founding partner of Gavekal Research.

Currently.neither of these scenarios appears. 9. Paul Wong.Market Strategist at Sprott Asset Management: If silver can consistently hold above $50.it could mean the market is reassessing silver's economic value and store-of-value function.which could also be a real-world reflection of the precious metal being repriced at market price. 10. Matthew Piggott.Director of Gold and Silver at Metals Focus: Due to silver's industrial metal properties.it underperformed gold mid-year due to trade concerns.with the gold-silver ratio briefly rising to 100.

This indicator is an important consideration for the Federal Reserve's decision to continue shrinking its balance sheet. According to data released by the Federal Reserve on Thursday.as of the week ending October 8th.bank reserves rose by approximately $54 billion.reaching $3.034 trillion. Prior to this.reserves had declined for eight consecutive weeks.the longest continuous decline since July 2020. This decline occurred as the US Treasury increased its debt issuance after raising the debt ceiling in July to rebuild its cash balance. This drained liquidity from other liabilities on the Federal Reserve's books.such as the overnight reverse repurchase agreement (ONRRP) and bank reserves. However.with the so-called ONRRP nearly exhausted.commercial bank reserves held at the Federal Reserve had been declining.

2025/10/10 8:11,【CICC: Fed Rate Cut Pace May Switch Between Fast-Slow-Fast】Jinshi Data.October 10th - CICC research report states that their baseline expectation is that the Fed's rate cut cycle may be divided into three stages: fast-slow-fast. The first stage is Q4 2025.with a relatively fast pace of rate cuts.possibly 3-4 consecutive cuts. The second stage is the first half of 2026.with a slower pace of rate cuts. As inflation continues to rise.the Fed may need to rebalance the risks of declining growth and rising inflation.and will be unable to continue rapidly cutting rates. The Fed may use a halt to its balance sheet reduction to appease financial markets. The second half of the year will be the third phase.with a renewed acceleration in the pace of interest rate cuts. Given that Powell's term expires in May 2026.we expect the Trump administration to likely nominate a more dovish Fed chair.and the inflation-boosting effect of tariffs may also be coming to an end.potentially leading the Fed to accelerate the pace of rate cuts again. In summary.we believe that Fed easing is the general trend for the coming year.with easing trades becoming the main theme in global markets.potentially driving down the dollar and generally benefiting various assets including Chinese and foreign stocks.bonds.commodities.and gold.

Saxo Bank's Chief Investment Strategist.Charu Chanana.stated.After a significant rally.Asian markets have generally entered a 'risk-averse' mode. She added.The decline in gold prices exacerbated the 'broad-based decline' atmosphere—partly due to profit-taking after hitting $4.000.and partly due to the geopolitical calm following the ceasefire announcement—therefore.classic safe-haven assets failed to provide a buffer for emerging markets today. Emerging market assets had a shaky start to the month.with currencies trading in a range.as the dollar performed unexpectedly well.strengthening broadly. Despite the ongoing US government shutdown.the dollar is still on track for its best weekly performance since November.suggesting that the dominant short-dollar trade this year is beginning to crack.

Pictet Senior Strategist Arun Sai stated.When there is a paradigm shift in the economic system.people always turn to gold. It is the ultimate 'currency devaluation hedge'. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon warned of a significant risk of a correction in the US stock market over the next six months to two years. Tariffs further exacerbating inflation concerns are another positive factor for gold. Rhona O'Connell.Head of Market Analysis at StoneX.pointed out that the efficient frontier theory partially explains the phenomenon of gold rising in tandem with the stock market. Gold typically moves inversely to stocks.making it a good risk hedging tool. When the stock market surges.some of the gains spill over into gold holdings. Concerns about a potential crash in the AI-driven stock market also make gold a hedging tool. Trevor Greetham.Head of Multi-Assets at Royal London Asset Management.said.People are equally bullish on AI and gold. If a deep recession and an AI bubble burst.gold could see another surge.

Global Maneuvering for the Nobel Prize: ① Core Objective: Driven by his supporters.Trump is actively campaigning for the Nobel Peace Prize. ② Main Measures: Over the past eight months.his administration has shuttled between several thorny conflicts around the world.engaging in intensive diplomacy. ③ External Assessment: Although a ceasefire was recently brokered in Gaza.analysts believe that the agreement may be too late to affect this year's Nobel Prize selection. II. Major Diplomatic Actions in the Second Term: 1. Caucasus Region: Facilitated the Joint Declaration between Armenia and Azerbaijan ① Actions: Leveraging trade relations for pressure and mediation.a joint declaration was signed by the leaders of both countries on August 8.pledging to seek peace. ② Outcomes: A non-legally binding joint declaration was facilitated; both sides reached an economic agreement with the United States.granting the US the right to develop a strategic corridor named after Trump. ③ Legacy Issues: Key issues.including Armenia's constitutional amendments.remain unresolved. 2. Southeast Asia: Intervention in the Cambodia-Thailand Border Conflict ① Background: Long-standing tensions between the two countries culminated in the deadliest.five-day military conflict in over a decade in July. ② Actions: Trump contacted Thai leaders after the conflict and withheld the tariff agreement as pressure. ③ Outcomes: Thailand returned to the negotiating table.ultimately reaching a fragile ceasefire agreement and resuming direct communication. ④ Follow-up: Trump subsequently imposed tariffs lower than initially planned.but tensions remained.and the new Thai leadership downplayed his role. 3. Middle East Core: Mediating a Ceasefire in Gaza and Countering Iran ① Achievements: Facilitated the first phase of the agreement between Israel and Hamas regarding a phased ceasefire and hostage exchange.marking significant progress in efforts to end the two-year Gaza war. ② Outstanding Issues: Key details regarding post-war governance of Gaza and Hamas's armed activities remain unresolved. ③ Iran Policy: Supported Israel's strikes against Iran and its supported groups; initially negotiated with Iran.later joined in Israeli airstrikes against Iranian nuclear facilities.and promoted a ceasefire brokered by Qatar; committed to expanding the Abraham Accords from its first term. ④ Iran Situation: Remains severe and unstable. Iran continues to reject US demands to halt uranium enrichment for its nuclear program. Israel has stated it will strike Iran again if it feels threatened. 4. Great Lakes Region.Africa: Promoting the Peace Agreement Between the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda ① Background: The M23 Movement.an anti-government armed group.launched a rapid offensive.and the Democratic Republic of Congo accused Rwanda of supporting the organization. ② Outcome: Under pressure from Trump.Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo signed a US-brokered peace agreement on June 27. ③ Current Situation: Fighting continues after the agreement was signed.and the conflict has deep roots. Trump warned that violating the agreement would result in very severe penalties in areas such as finance. 5. South Asia: Easing Tensions Between India and Pakistan ① Background: Conflict broke out between the two nuclear-armed states in May due to an attack.posing a risk of spiraling out of control. ② Actions: After consulting with Trump.the US Secretary of State and Vice President promoted de-escalation efforts between officials from both sides. ③ Outcome: After four days of fighting.both sides announced a ceasefire on May 10. ④ Controversy: Trump claimed to be using trade as a means of pressure.but India denied this. 6. East Africa: Intervention in the Egypt-Ethiopia Dam Dispute ① Background: A long-standing dispute exists between the two sides over the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD).with Egypt fearing a threat to its Nile River water supply. ② Actions: Trump claimed in July that the issue was being resolved.and the White House added it to its list of end-of-contest conflicts. ③ Progress: Trump's specific actions are unclear.but his public statements have been biased towards Egypt. Ethiopia inaugurated the dam in September despite opposition. 7. Balkans: Focus on Serbia-Kosovo Relations ① Background: An economic agreement was brokered between the two countries during Trump's first term.but political relations remain tense. ② Actions: Trump claimed in June that he had prevented a war between the two countries and expressed a willingness to intervene again. ③ Controversy: The Kosovo president claimed that Trump recently prevented escalation.but the Serbian president denied this. 8. Europe: Limited Progress in the Russia-Ukraine Conflict ① Background: The conflict has lasted for nearly four years.with analysts saying it has caused more than 1 million casualties.and a ceasefire has yet to be achieved. ② Stance: Trump claimed during his campaign that he could end the conflict quickly.and in August he acknowledged that the Ukraine issue was one of the most difficult. ③ Position: His views on how best to achieve peace have wavered.and his attitude towards Putin has shifted from threats to disappointment. ④ External Concerns: Europe is worried that it may pressure Ukraine to accept territorial concessions to Russia. 9. Korean Peninsula: Recognizing North Korea's Nuclear Weapons and Seeking Dialogue ① Diplomatic Legacy: Trump held three summits with Kim Jong-un during his first term.but diplomacy ultimately broke down. ② Commitments: In June.Trump pledged to resolve the conflict with North Korea; in his second term.he recognized North Korea as a nuclear-armed state. ③ Current Position: The White House welcomes renewed communication with Kim Jong-un.and North Korea has stated that it is willing to negotiate if the US abandons its denuclearization demands.

According to Pansen Macro's estimates.Eurozone GDP may have grown slightly in the third quarter.by approximately 0.1%. Vistesen points out that this estimate is more optimistic than the ECB's own forecast (i.e..flat GDP for the quarter). He states that the ECB may consider the current lack of economic momentum to be temporary.mainly due to a sharp decline in manufacturing output. He writes in the report.Therefore.the threshold for these GDP figures to significantly increase the likelihood of an ECB rate cut in December or early next year remains very High.

In a written statement.Powell said that despite the disruption to official economic data caused by the federal government shutdown.the employment and inflation outlook appears to have changed little since our September meeting. when the Fed conducted its first rate cut this year. The Fed lowered its key interest rate. At that meeting.Fed officials also projected two more rate cuts this year and one more in 2026. Furthermore.Powell reiterated the message he first conveyed after the September meeting.when he stated that the Fed's concerns about the labor market were slightly greater than its other mandate.maintaining price stability. He said tariffs had raised the Fed's preferred inflation gauge to 2.9%.but outside of tariffs.there were no broader inflationary pressures keeping prices High. He stated.The increased downside risks to employment have changed our assessment of the balance of risks. Additionally.Powell spent much of his speech defending the Fed's purchases of long-term Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities in 2020 and 2021.a move intended to lower long-term interest rates and support the economy during the pandemic. However.these purchases drew sharp criticism from Treasury Secretary Bessant and some of the Trump administration's candidates.with Powell claiming the move was to prevent a collapse in the U.S. Treasury market.which could otherwise see yields rise sharply.

2025/10/15 2:36,【Jinshi Data Summary: Key Points of Powell's Speech - Balance Sheet Reduction End Date Approaching.Downside Risks to Employment Increase】 1. Economic Situation: Data before the US government shutdown showed that economic growth may have been better than expected. Current data indicates that the economic situation is consistent with that in September. 2. Employment Situation: Downside risks to the US job market have increased. Recent data shows that the job market is characterized by low growth and low unemployment. There will be no attempt to lock in a balanced level of employment; the standard error itself may be 50.000. There is considerable uncertainty regarding the balanced level of job creation.which may have fallen below zero. 3. Balance Sheet Reduction: Balance sheet reduction may be nearing its end in the coming months. The Fed is believed to have more flexible space regarding the size of its balance sheet. It remains committed to achieving a balance sheet holding only Treasury bonds for a longer period. 4. Inflation Situation: Current data shows that tariffs are pushing up price pressures. Rising commodity prices mainly reflect tariffs.rather than general inflationary pressures. The slow transmission risk of tariffs is beginning to manifest as persistent inflation. 5. Policy Path: There is currently no risk-free path for monetary policy. If the Fed acts too quickly.it could derail the fight against inflation. Acting too slowly could put pressure on the labor market. Other Key Points: If the government shutdown continues and October data is delayed.the Fed will begin missing data.making the situation more severe. There are few good substitutes for government inflation data. The Fed has successfully weathered the crisis.outperforming even more than any other country in the world.

A strong short squeeze has pushed the benchmark price above $50 per ounce. Anant Jatia.Chief Investment Officer of Greenland Investment Management.said: There is currently no liquidity in the market. What we are seeing in the silver market is completely unprecedented. The London Bullion Market Association (LBMA) acknowledged tensions in the silver market and stated it is closely monitoring the situation. Daily silver auction prices in London have now broken records. The spot premium relative to New York futures has widened to as much as $3.while the annualized rate of overnight borrowing costs has climbed above 100%. In 1980.regulators quelled the Hunt brothers' short squeeze by restricting the opening of new positions on US exchanges. That mechanism no longer exists. Precious metals analyst Vincent Lanci stated that easing the pressure now depends on increasing physical supply: either through ETF liquidations (i.e..selling physical silver) or through overseas shipments. Some traders have already begun moving silver by air.

Li Shuaihua.chief analyst of non-ferrous new materials at China Post Securities.said that in the short term.three factors are driving the rise in gold prices. First.the Fed's interest rate cut in September released liquidity.attracting trading funds to flow into the gold market; second.escalating global geopolitical conflicts have boosted risk aversion; third.central banks around the world are accelerating the diversification of reserves to hedge against the credit risk of the US dollar.and the holdings of gold ETFs continue to grow. In addition.the US federal government shutdown.This further stimulates market risk aversion. Li Shuaihua believes that.in the long term.firstly.the US fiscal deficit and debt risks are unlikely to be resolved in the short term. High interest rates increase the interest burden on US Treasury bonds.exacerbating market concerns about the dollar's credibility and driving continued demand for gold from central banks worldwide. Secondly.factors such as trade frictions are weakening the dollar's dominance.highlighting gold's strategic value as a safe-haven asset. Finally.international geopolitical conflicts and the Middle East situation are unlikely to subside in the short term.supporting gold's long-term safe-haven attributes. If the aforementioned variables (such as fiscal deficits.de-dollarization.and geopolitical conflicts) do not significantly reverse.the long-term upward trend in gold prices will continue.

The yield on 10-year UK government bonds fell 5 basis points to 4.54%.a two-month Low. heading for its biggest four-day drop since April. Money markets currently expect the Bank of England to cut rates by 25 basis points in February next year to stimulate the economy.and then cut again in the third quarter of next year. Bailey's concerns stemmed from weak UK labor market data released on Tuesday. Demand for UK bonds is strong as investors want to lock in rates before yields fall further. said Evelyne.a strategist at Mizuho. Gomez-Liechti stated that.in addition to the weak job market.demand was also strong for the UK's 2041-maturity treasury bonds issued by the Office for the Management of the Debt on Tuesday.with subscriptions exceeding £128 billion.
2025/10/15 17:36,【Jinshi Data Compilation: London Silver Liquidity Nearly Dry Up—How Will This Short Squeeze End?】 Why did silver prices surge this time? 1. Soaring Leasing Rates: Silver leasing rates have soared to unprecedented levels. As of October 10.2025.the annualized rate for one month exceeded 30%. These rates.representing the cost of borrowing physical metal in the London market.have remained high throughout 2025.but have reached extremes in recent weeks. 2. Strong Indian Demand: A surge in strong demand from India has systematically depleted available silver inventories in London. While this increase in Indian purchases is consistent with traditional seasonal patterns.its intensity has exceeded usual levels. 3. Inventory Misalignment: At the beginning of 2025.concerns about the potential impact of tariffs on silver triggered a large volume of metal shipments from London to New York.creating a difficult-to-resolve inventory misalignment. 4. Tariff Concerns Persist: The ongoing Section 232 investigation in the US regarding key minerals (including silver.platinum.and palladium) continues to influence trader behavior.despite precious metals being officially exempt from tariffs since April 2025. 5. Price Amplification Effect: The silver market is relatively small compared to gold (approximately one-ninth in value).which amplifies price volatility when supply is tight. How Does a Short Squeeze Work? 1. Short Borrowing Pressure: Short sellers in the London market are forced to borrow physical metal at escalating lease rates.now exceeding 30% annualized. 2. Forced Short Covering: These extreme borrowing costs make rolling over short positions prohibitively expensive.creating a strong incentive to cover them by purchasing physical metal. 3. Physical Inventory Shortage: As short sellers simultaneously attempt to cover their positions.they encounter a shortage of available physical inventory.further pushing up prices. 4. Price Self-Reinforcing: As more short positions are closed.this behavior creates additional buying pressure.forming a self-reinforcing price momentum. 5. Small Market.High Volatility: The silver market is relatively small compared to gold.which amplifies these price movements.resulting in greater volatility and more extreme price misalignments. How is this different from previous ones? 1. Market Forces Driven: The current short squeeze appears to be driven by broader market forces.rather than concentrated investor manipulation. 2. More Mature Regulation: Modern markets are far more mature in terms of regulatory oversight than in the Hunt brothers' era. Position limits.enhanced reporting requirements.and greater transparency provide regulators with better tools to monitor and address potential market abuse. 3. Upgraded Trading Infrastructure: Today's global trading infrastructure creates different price pressure transmission mechanisms. Electronic trading platforms enable faster position adjustments and market responses. 4. Macro Sentiment-Driven: The current short squeeze is occurring against a backdrop of broader precious metal strength.with gold also reaching all-time highs. This indicates that macroeconomic and investor sentiment factors are contributing to the overall environment.not just isolated manipulation in silver. How will this short squeeze end? 1. 1. Physical Transport Relief: Increased physical silver shipments to London will alleviate immediate supply constraints. 2. High Prices Suppress Demand: Price-induced demand destruction may reduce physical buying pressure. 3. Short Covering Completion: The completion of short position unwinding will remove a significant source of buying pressure. 4. Regulatory Intervention: Regulatory intervention may ensure market order if market disruptions persist beyond acceptable levels. 5. Increased Available Inventory: New supply sources entering the market at higher price points will ultimately increase available inventory.

Hidayat also stated that there is a possibility that this silver short squeeze could spread to other metal markets. Signs of tension have already appeared in the gold and palladium markets. The silver short squeeze could trigger similar dynamics in other precious metals.especially those with industrial applications and limited supply. Metals mentioned in the Section 232 investigation (silver.platinum.and palladium) may be particularly vulnerable to spillover effects.

A drop below 4% in the 10-year Treasury yield would mark its lowest level since early April; the 2-year Treasury yield is nearing levels seen three years ago. Federal Reserve Chairman Powell stated on Tuesday that the Fed may cut rates again this month due to signs of economic weakness. He also hinted that the Fed might soon end its balance sheet reduction operation.which also boosted the Treasury yield. Pepperstone senior strategist Michael Brown stated that current yield levels reflect investors' expectations that the federal funds rate will fall from its current level of approximately 4.25% to 3% by the middle of next year. However.he pointed out that unless Trump's tariff threats trigger new market panic.Treasury yields are unlikely to fall further in the short term.

2025/10/16 17:50,[World Gold Council Research Head: Gold Market Not Yet Saturated.Long-Term Macroeconomic Support Factors Have Not Disappeared] Jinshi Data.October 16th.Juan Carlos.Research Head of the World Gold Council Artigas stated that although gold has hit 45 all-time highs this year.speculative positions and net long positions in the futures market have not yet reached historical peaks.indicating that the market is not yet saturated. Furthermore.the global central bank gold-buying trend continues.suggesting potential for further capital inflows. Gold's safe-haven + inflation hedge attributes remain attractive in an environment of rising economic uncertainty.therefore.it is inappropriate to judge market overheating solely based on short-term price increases. The fundamental reason for gold's continued rise is the market's search for alternatives to dollar assets. The earlier catalyst was the Russia-Ukraine conflict.leading to a desire to increase gold holdings to avoid the freezing of dollar assets. The current catalysts are US policy uncertainty and the high debt levels of developed countries' governments. Overall.some investors are currently taking a wait-and-see approach due to concerns about potential pullbacks after entering the market.given the already high gold prices. However.in the long term.the supporting macroeconomic factors have not disappeared. (Yicai)

Some investors are warning of the risk of a correction due to crowded gold trading and short-term overbuying. However.we believe that central bank gold purchases are the biggest guarantee for gold prices to continue to reach new highs. After the collapse of the Bretton Woods system in the early 1970s.the United States was able to establish the 'petrodollar' system in less than 10 years.restoring the credibility of the dollar.mainly due to the United States' strong industrial capacity and global 'hegemon' status at the time. But now.with the hollowing out of US manufacturing.once the existing 'petrodollar' system collapses.the United States and China are unlikely to be able to rebuild the global reserve currency system independently. In the future.there may be a long-term era without a single reserve currency.and gold is expected to usher in a long-term bull market.

Fed Chairman Powell hinted in his speech earlier this month that he is waiting for the right time to end the balance sheet reduction.and last week's slight fluctuations in the repurchase market may be a key signal. The institution also expects the Fed to begin purchasing US Treasury bonds to offset maturing mortgage-backed securities.thereby maintaining the stability of its overall balance sheet. In short.as the Fed shifts to a neutral policy stance.the supply of short-term Treasury bonds in the market may decrease by about $20 billion per month.
2025/10/20 21:22,[Institution: Fed May Consider Lowering Reserve Interest Rate to Ease Financing Pressure] According to Jinshi Data on October 20th.in response to the slight tightness in the repo market last week.the Fed may lower the interest rate paid to banks on the balance of reserves. Currently.this rate is 15 basis points above the lower limit of the federal funds target range—given the current target range of 4%-4.25%.the actual rate is 4.15%. If this rate is lowered by 5 basis points.banks will be more inclined to forgo reserve interest and instead invest funds in the repo market. This move will help curb volatility in market repo rates. Analysts at research firm Wrightson ICAP expect the Fed will eventually implement this fine-tuning.but they point out that making such a decision at next week's October meeting may be premature.

This historic gold rally has paused as India's Diwali gold-buying season ends. After hitting a high of $4.381 per ounce on Monday.gold prices plummeted to $4.082 on Tuesday.a move widely seen as a belated correction. The historic rally this year accelerated in recent weeks.with a 25% increase in just the past two months. Nicky Shiels.Head of Metals Strategy at MKS PAMP SA.said: The market is showing signs of a bubble.with the main catalyst being extreme overbought conditions – this rally is peaking. The fact that it has surged $1.000 in six weeks indicates that gold prices are overvalued.and we are at an irrational High. Analysts pointed out that the recent rebound in the US dollar and the lack of futures market positioning data due to the US government shutdown jointly contributed to this most dramatic drop in gold prices since 2013.

WisdomTree Commodity Strategist Nitesh Shah: Gold prices still have room to rise.but the current rally is too aggressive.and a technical correction is inevitable after each new High. 3. Nicky Shiels.Head of Metals Strategy at MKS PAMP SA: The market is showing signs of a bubble.with the main catalyst being extremely overbought conditions—this rally is peaking. The fact that gold prices have surged by $1.000 in six weeks indicates that they are overvalued.and we are at an irrational High. 4. Independent metals trader Tai Wong said: Silver's sharp drop today dragged down the entire precious metals sector. Although there was still buying when gold prices fell yesterday.the sharp rise in high volatility over the past week is a warning sign that may trigger profit-taking.at least in the short term. 5. Saxo Bank Commodity Strategist Ole Hansen: In recent trading days.more and more traders have become wary of the risk of a pullback. The market is showing its true strength during adjustments.and this time is no exception. Bottom-level buying may limit the decline. 6. Kathleen Brooks.Research Director at XTB: The recent sharp drop in gold and silver prices lacked a clear catalyst. Overvaluation coupled with signals that US CPI data might be weaker than expected triggered the sell-off. A pullback is not necessarily a bad thing. Despite the larger-than-expected decline.the fundamental factors driving gold and silver prices up remain solid. 7. Sim Moh Siong.FX Strategist at Bank of Singapore: The recent rise in gold prices may have been a bit too big and too fast. However.concerns about G10 fiscal sustainability and central bank independence will persist until 2026.making it difficult to say whether gold will peak soon. 8. Tim Waterer.Chief Market Analyst at KCM Trade: Profit-taking and weakening safe-haven inflows have combined to diminish gold's advantage today. Any pullback in gold will be seen as a buying opportunity.as the Fed is still on a rate-cutting track.

Furthermore.this type of account may not be able to use the Fed's discount window for emergency lending.but may enjoy a simplified review process.

Gold prices have surged.with COMEX gold futures prices soaring to above $4.300 per ounce.setting new historical highs. Oil prices.however.have remained under pressure.with US WTI crude oil futures prices falling below $56 per barrel.a new low since early May this year.

Industry insiders say that the recent rise in gold prices is mainly due to increased expectations of a Fed rate cut.rising market risk aversion.and a weakening dollar. The weakening of oil prices is mainly affected by industry fundamentals.with the contradiction of overcapacity caused by loose supply and weakening demand becoming more prominent.

The decline continued into the Asian session today.with gold prices falling to a low of $4004 in the morning.

2025/10/22 18:12,[Institution: Bank of England Needs Clear Downward Trend in Inflation Before Next Rate Cut] According to Jinshi Data on October 22nd.Berenberg Bank economist Andrew Wishart pointed out that the Bank of England may need to wait for a clearer downward trend in service sector inflation before cutting rates again. The UK inflation rate remained at 3.8% in September.lower than market expectations and the Bank of England's forecast. Wishart stated.'Following lower-than-expected wage growth in August.there is increasing evidence that inflation is cooling faster than the central bank anticipated.' However.he also pointed out that businesses still plan to raise sales prices over the next year.meaning that the decline in core inflation in September does not represent the start of a downward trend. Wishart predicts that persistent core inflation and service sector inflation will likely prevent the central bank from implementing another rate cut this year.

A Wall Street Journal survey of economists indicates that the CPI report.scheduled for release this Friday.may show that the overall price rate rose 3.1% year-on-year in December. Rising inflation will highlight the impact of Trump's tariffs.which have been rising almost every month since Trump announced them in April. Despite rising prices.lower rent increases may prevent overall inflation from rising excessively. Core inflation is expected to rise 3.1% year-on-year in September.unchanged from August. In conclusion. Inflation may not rise significantly enough to deter the Federal Reserve from cutting interest rates in late October.

The energy sub-item rose 0.7% in August\ and may also show a rapid growth rate in September. The household food sub-item rose 0.6% in August\.and the growth in September may slow down. The core CPI monthly rate in September is likely to reach 0.3% again\.which may round up to 0.4%. In addition.the overall and core CPI annual rates in September are likely to both approach 3.0%\.a full percentage point higher than the Fed's 2.0% target. For the Federal Reserve.the level of inflation may be less concerning than the direction of its change. Inflation is more likely to rise than fall.at least until the full impact of tariffs is passed on to consumers. The problem becomes more complicated if new tariffs are implemented and the expulsions affect more industries. Unless a major recession occurs.it is difficult to imagine inflation reaching the Fed's target in the near term.

The continued US government shutdown and geopolitical tensions boosted gold prices.while market expectations of further interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve also provided support. Traders will closely monitor changes in the trade situation.after gold experienced a sharp sell-off due to easing trade tensions and a rebound in dollar demand. Russell.Senior Market Analyst at Tradu.com Shor stated that the sell-off appears to be primarily a technical correction.as gold prices had been overbought since September.prompting investors to take profits. Despite the pullback.gold prices have still risen by approximately 55% this year.and the long-term upward trend remains strong. Profit-taking ahead of Friday's CPI data release is also a contributing factor to the sell-off. With the US government shutdown halting economic data releases.Friday's release of the September US CPI inflation data is highly anticipated. Higher-than-expected data could boost the dollar in the short term and put pressure on gold prices.

The core reason behind this was the significant decline in risk aversion driven by multiple factors. However.during the period of global order restructuring.gold remains the most suitable safe-haven asset. We believe that the short-term decline does not affect the long-term logic of gold; the pullback actually provides an opportunity to increase positions. We suggest refocusing on gold after it stabilizes. On the 22nd.the stock price decline of typical gold companies was better than the gold price itself.indicating that the market's consensus on the long-term allocation value of gold-related assets has not changed.

2025/10/24 8:26,【Minsheng Securities: US Core Inflation to Face Upward Turning Point in Q4】Jinshi Data.October 24th - Minsheng Securities released a research report stating that September's inflation was just the beginning of a series of data shocks. The accelerated rise in inflation in the fourth quarter and the possibility of better-than-expected employment data will make the Federal Reserve more cautious in its easing path. This means that the market's previous blind euphoria is entering a cooling-off period.and the short-term consolidation phase for precious metals and risk assets may continue. Minsheng Securities believes that core inflation in the fourth quarter will face an upward turning point in year-on-year growth. Approaching an upward inflection point. With a new round of restocking demand in the US.the gradual removal of bonded warehouse inventory after tariffs take effect.and the dilution of corporate profit margins.the quarter-on-quarter increase may accelerate further.meaning that inflationary pressures will intensify further in the fourth quarter. Against the backdrop of accelerating inflation.the final interest rate path may not be as optimistic as the market expects (the current market pricing in three more rate cuts until January next year). The fourth quarter is likely to see a reverse correction: a gradually recovering job market following rate cuts coexisting with accelerating inflation.which may lead the Federal Reserve to pause rate cuts in December or January next year.

Besides the frequent fluctuations caused by the trade war.the market has recently been boosted by a strong corporate earnings season. According to data tracked by the Atlanta Fed.before the government shutdown.US GDP growth in the third quarter was close to 4%.showing that the economy still possesses remarkable resilience. While shaking this optimistic narrative is not easy.an unexpected CPI figure could be the trigger. Stephanie Link.Chief Investment Strategist at Hightower Advisors.said: If the CPI data is higher than expected.I expect market volatility to intensify. However.I would view this as a buying opportunity because the economy remains strong.the Federal Reserve has begun its rate-cutting cycle.corporate profits are growing at double-digit rates.and the fourth quarter is historically the strongest quarter of the year.

Given that inflation is close to the policy target and the economy is maintaining robust growth.the ECB is likely to maintain current interest rates. The market has largely priced in this expectation.and ECB President Lagarde is unlikely to signal a future rate cut. The bank stated.'With the continued shutdown of the US federal government and geopolitical uncertainty becoming the focus.we expect the euro's short-term weakness to continue for several weeks.' However.TD Securities believes that unless relations between the US and countries like Russia deteriorate significantly.the euro will not fall below the 1.15 level against the dollar and expects it to eventually recover to 1.18. The current euro/dollar exchange rate is 1.1608.

Analysts say this means the Fed will almost certainly cut rates again next week.and the data also supports the Trump administration's view that inflation is under control and tariffs will not cause a surge in the cost of living. Analysts point out that data shows gasoline prices appear to be the driving factor for the overall indicators: the gasoline price index rose 4.1% in September.the largest monthly increase among all items.

Economists point out that businesses have achieved this at the expense of hiring and estimate that consumers have so far borne about 20% of the tariff costs.

The market generally expects the Fed to cut rates by another 25 basis points.

Data released by the US Bureau of Labor Statistics on Friday showed that the US September CPI annual rate was 3.0%.higher than August's 2.9%.but lower than the 3.1% expected by economists surveyed by the Wall Street Journal. The core CPI annual rate was 3%.also lower than the expected 3.1%. The report was released more than a week later than expected due to the government shutdown halting economic data collection. Inflation has remained above the Fed's 2% target. Tariffs have pushed up the prices of some imported goods.such as furniture. Fed officials are expected to cut interest rates again at next week's meeting.but they are divided on whether to prioritize boosting employment or curbing inflation.
2025/10/24 20:47,[Institution: Inflation Data Unlikely to Affect Fed Rate Cut Decision] Jinshi Data.October 24th: Institutional analysis points out that.as the Fed has entered its quiet period before its October 29th policy decision.its officials will not comment on Friday's inflation data before the decision is made. However.this lower-than-expected data seems unlikely to prevent the market from widely pricing in a 25 basis point rate cut. Currently.the Fed is in a data blind spot—the government shutdown resulted in the absence of September PPI data.forcing the central bank to rely on imperfect PCE estimates for judgment.and no official employment data has been available since the government shutdown earlier this month. Fed Chairman Powell has not disputed the expectation of an October rate cut in recent public speeches.

This is the only official economic data released during the government shutdown.showing that the overall CPI rose 0.3% month-on-month and 3.0% year-on-year.both lower than market expectations of 0.4% and 3.1%.respectively. The core CPI.excluding food and energy.rose 0.2% month-on-month and 3.0% year-on-year. The figure was also 3.0%.lower than the expected values of 0.3% and 3.1%.respectively. This report provides a window into the US economy during the period of complete suspension of economic data releases. However.the subsequent policy path remains unclear: there are persistent concerns that Trump's tariff policies may trigger a new round of runaway inflation.while Federal Reserve policymakers worry that weak hiring this year may spread (although the layoff rate remains low). Federal Reserve Chairman Powell and his colleagues have remained cautious about the pace of interest rate cuts while weighing the threat of inflation against the weakness in the labor market.while Trump insists that inflation is no longer a problem and demands aggressive rate cuts from the Federal Reserve.

Tiffany Wilding.an economist at Pacific Investment Management Company (PIMCO).stated that this indicates signs of normalization in the housing and rental market that economists have long anticipated.and this trend is likely to continue as stricter immigration policies ease pressures on housing demand. Wilding added.This should reassure the Federal Reserve—excluding some tariff-related cost pass-through.current inflationary pressures are generally quite moderate.

Analysts point out that it is important to note that to release October inflation data.staff at the US Bureau of Labor Statistics must collect price information during October—which.in reality.was almost entirely absent from their posts. Economists point out that releasing October employment data may be relatively easier—after all.companies know which employees they have hired or laid off and have relevant records—but if no price surveys were conducted in October.reconstructing a CPI report will be extremely difficult. Analysts believe that this White House statement truly reminds the market that without key data.the Fed's December policy decision will become extremely complex. Policymakers may still have confidence in their assessment of the employment situation.but their grasp of the inflation trend is clearly insufficient.

2025/10/24 21:22,【Institution: CPI provides confidence for Fed rate cut.but tariffs and economic slowdown risks still need to be guarded against】Jinshi Data.October 24th.Edward Jones Senior Investment Strategist Mona Mahajan stated that the slightly lower-than-expected September CPI was reassuring. Despite the lack of complete labor market data.this still provides more justification for the Federal Reserve to continue its planned rate-cutting path from September. The ADP report and ISM survey data have already shown some weakness in the labor market.and today's CPI data further confirms that inflation has not experienced an unusual surge that could have made the Fed hesitate; this logic remains valid. The Fed is moving towards a neutral interest rate level and may hope to lower the federal funds rate to around 3.5% over the next year or so. Current inflation remains above the bank's 2% target.and the full impact of tariffs on goods inflation has not yet materialized. However.it should be noted that goods only account for one-third of the CPI basket.while inflation in the services sector.which accounts for two-thirds.remains under control.which will support the narrative of moderate overall inflation. It is worth noting that the economy may have slowed during the government shutdown. Current inflation data has not yet reflected this impact.but we will closely monitor signs of an economic slowdown.

Given the lack of economic indicators other than private sector data due to the US government shutdown.if inflation can maintain its current level rather than surge.it will allow the Fed to focus more on the job market—an ideal scenario for the central bank.

Although the price-driven effects of tariffs are still evident.they are not as severe as previously feared. This makes a Fed rate cut next week likely. The Fed is expected to cut rates again by 25 basis points next Wednesday.bringing the target range for the federal funds rate down to 3.75%-4.00%. This is the Fed's response to increased risks in the labor market.while inflation risks have been downgraded. In short.there is nothing in today's inflation report that could change the Fed's rate cut next week.
2025/10/24 21:32,[Institutions: Housing Costs Become a Key Driving Force.CPI Data Opens Up More Room for Interest Rate Cuts] Jinshi Data.October 24th: Wasif Latif.Chief Investment Officer of Sarmaya Partners.stated that inflation data was at least generally lower than expected.which relieved pressure on the market. Looking at the sub-items.housing costs were the main factor pulling down inflation. In the absence of other comprehensive economic data.this alone has reassured the market—the futures market.bonds.and commodities (gold has recovered from its lows) have all reacted. Although the US trading session has just begun.and the market still needs to digest the details.the initial reaction is positive.as the data provides the Federal Reserve with more room to maneuver in cutting interest rates. Ultimately.this round of market activity has always been driven by expectations of interest rate cuts. The greater the Federal Reserve's policy space.the more the market benefits—this means both liquidity support from interest rate cuts and hints at the possibility of other monetary easing. Lower bond yields also benefit the fiscal side.helping government financing and future bond issuance. Overall.this data can be considered positive.

A slight increase in confidence among younger consumers was offset by a decline in confidence among older consumers. Current personal financial situations have improved slightly.but future financial expectations have weakened. Overall.consumers believe the economic environment has not changed substantially compared to last month.with inflation and high prices remaining core concerns. There were almost no signs this month that consumers linked the federal government shutdown to their economic situation. Only about 2% of respondents actively mentioned the shutdown in their interviews.far lower than the 10% mention rate during the 35-day shutdown in 2019. Short-term inflation expectations fell to 4.6% from 4.7% in September.currently at the midpoint between the peak in the same period last year and the peak after the tariff policy announcement in May of this year. Long-term inflation expectations rose to 3.9% from 3.7%.but remain below the annual high reached in April—this month's increase was mainly driven by independents and Republicans.

The disturbance in the housing component led to an unexpected decline in September inflation. Given the ongoing government shutdown and overall cooling of the job market.a rate cut by the Federal Reserve in October is highly probable.with a December rate cut being the baseline scenario. The impact of this round of tariffs on inflation may be characterized by a relatively small overall magnitude but a relatively long duration.thus having a relatively limited constraint on the Federal Reserve's rate cuts. However.the continued government shutdown and the expiration of the DOGE buyout program will impact the fragile US job market in the short term.and the Federal Reserve needs to guard against the risk of a rapid weakening of the job market. Therefore.Huatai Securities maintains its judgment that the Federal Reserve will cut rates once in October and once in December.

This round of gold price declines has triggered investor concerns about whether gold prices will repeat the longest bear market from the 1980s to the end of the 20th century. Wang Youxin.director of the Bank of China Research Institute.believes that although gold prices may continue to face downward pressure in the short term.and multiple factors are weakening gold's safe-haven appeal.the current situation is different from that time. The global economic environment and monetary policies at that time are very different from now. Currently.the possibility of a long-term weakening of the US dollar is relatively High.global liquidity will be further eased.and factors such as continued gold purchases by global central banks.geopolitical risks.and inflation expectations are still present. Therefore.gold is unlikely to repeat the long-term decline of that year. After the concentrated release of short-term pressure.it is expected to consolidate and stabilize. he said.

2025/10/29 9:59,【Golden Ten Summary: Recent Interest Rate Views of Fed Voting Members Diverge in Three Directions】 Advocating a Significant Rate Cut 1. Fed Governor Milan: Supports a 50 basis point rate cut in October. Two more rate cuts this year sound realistic. The difference in policy views with colleagues is more based on the speed of rate cuts than the ultimate goal of rate cuts. Dovish 1. Fed Chairman Powell: Liquidity in the money market is gradually tightening.and balance sheet reduction may be nearing its end in the coming months; recent economic activity data is stronger than expected.and the downside risks to the job market are rising. Acting too slowly may suppress employment.while acting too quickly may cause the anti-inflation task to be abandoned halfway. 2. Fed Governor Waller: Supports a 25 basis point rate cut in October. Officials can gradually ease monetary policy by cutting rates by 25 basis points each time to support the weak labor market. Rate cuts are necessary.but should be done cautiously. 3. Fed Governor Bowman: Continues to expect two more rate cuts before the end of the year. As long as the labor market and other economic data develop in the direction I expect.we will continue along the path of lowering the federal funds rate. 4. Fed Governor Collins: Given the reduced risks to inflation and concerns about the labor market.further rate cuts seem prudent. and another 25 basis point cut might be appropriate. 5. Fed Governor Williams: Supports further rate cuts this year.although inflation has deviated from the central bank's 2% target in recent months. Rate cuts are to prevent the labor market from further widening. Hawkish: 1. Fed Vice Chairman Jefferson: Inflation and employment targets are at risk.caution is needed. 2. Fed Governor Barr: The Fed should be cautious about further rate cuts; current interest rates are moderately restrictive.tariffs pose risks to inflation.and the generally balanced labor market has potential vulnerabilities. 3. Fed's Mossalaim: Skeptical of further rate cuts. He supports a 25 basis point rate cut in September due to increased risks in the labor market.but further cuts could indicate excessive complacency regarding price increases.given that inflation is nearly one percentage point above the Fed's 2% target. 4. Fed's Schmid: Inclined towards no further rate cuts. He believes the Fed should continue to monitor the risk of excessive inflation as it seeks to balance the risks of both overly tight and overly loose policy. 5. Fed's Goolsby: Cautious about premature and significant rate cuts.not expecting inflation to subside on its own. He sees both aspects of the Fed's dual mandate deteriorating.

Peter Fertig.an analyst at Quantitative Commodity Research.said: Gold has fallen by more than 10% in the past period.and there may be buying opportunities now.as the basic logic for gold's rise still holds. Some central bank foreign exchange reserve managers may also take the opportunity to increase their gold holdings.using this pullback as a buying opportunity. ANZ Bank noted in a report: Progress in trade negotiations continues to weaken demand for safe-haven assets such as gold.and as tensions ease.gold prices have further retreated. However.this decline may provide an opportunity for central banks to increase their gold reserves. Meanwhile.the market widely expects the Federal Reserve to announce a 25-basis-point rate cut at its policy meeting early this morning.and investors are closely watching any forward-looking signals that Chairman Powell may release.

Today.relevant officials from the China Nonferrous Metals Industry Association analyzed and interpreted the recent gold price situation and its future trend. The China Nonferrous Metals Industry Association stated that since 2025.international and domestic gold prices have continued to rise.repeatedly reaching new historical highs. The international spot gold price once approached $4400/ounce in mid-October.while the domestic gold price broke through the 900 yuan/gram mark. Experts believe that this round of gold price increases is the result of a confluence of multiple macroeconomic factors: on the one hand.it is influenced by the global gold investment boom in recent years and the large-scale increase in holdings by central banks in emerging economies; on the other hand.geopolitical factors and current inflationary pressures are also continuously supporting the rise in international gold prices. Duan Shaofu.Deputy Secretary-General of the China Nonferrous Metals Industry Association.stated that currently.the driving factors propelling gold prices have not diminished.but the risks brought by short-term fluctuations cannot be ignored. Rapid changes in market sentiment.the impact of unforeseen events.and the inflow and outflow of speculative funds could all lead to significant short-term fluctuations in gold prices.

The Dallas Fed estimated in early October that the current break-even point was around 30.000 jobs per month.while 57.000 is far higher. Due to the lack of government data.the strong rebound signal from ADP data may make Fed Chairman Powell more cautious when hinting at a December rate cut. If so.this would be seen as a hawkish surprise and significantly impact the market. Furthermore.Waller.the most dovish Fed governor (one of the Fed Chair candidates).has also stated that ADP data is one of his reasons for supporting a rate cut.

It is also expected that the central bank will announce the end of quantitative tightening (QT). This meeting will not release a quarterly economic forecast report.therefore the focus will mainly be on Powell's press conference. It is expected that Fed Chairman Powell will again characterize the rate cut as a risk management measure.and in the absence of key economic data.will not reveal too much information to maintain market stability. Currently.the market expects a Fed rate cut in October to be a certainty.and the probability of a rate cut in December is also close to 100%.with a cumulative rate cut of 117 basis points in 2026.higher than the Fed's expected 75 basis points.
2025/10/29 20:39,【Fed Decision Preview: Several Potential Changes in the Statement】Jinshi Data.October 29th: According to foreign media analysis.the Federal Reserve may revise its policy statement in the following ways. In the first two paragraphs.the Fed may change its wording to acknowledge the recovery in economic activity.may remove the phrase 'rising inflation.' maintain other statements on inflation and employment unchanged.and may mention the uncertainty caused by the lack of data due to the government shutdown. In the third paragraph.the Fed will modify its target range to reflect the decision to cut interest rates. The wording regarding QT will change the most.as the Fed is expected to signal the end of quantitative tightening at this or the next meeting. In the final paragraph.we may see Fed Governor Milan oppose a 25 basis point rate cut and vote for a 50 basis point cut.or we may see Kansas City Fed President Schmid oppose the rate cut and support maintaining the current rate.as he is one of the most hawkish voting members. These possible changes are largely expected by the market and will not be surprising.
2025/10/29 20:48,【Fed Decision Preview: Powell's Press Conference May Contain Hawkish Surprises】Jinshi Data.October 29th: According to foreign media analysis.the press conference of Federal Reserve Chairman Powell is the most watched event by the market. The current situation is that.in the absence of government data.Chairman Powell will maintain the status quo and will not reveal much in terms of forward guidance. The only thing that might surprise the market is his expression of uncertainty about a December rate cut.which would likely be seen as a hawkish surprise.as the market is currently confident of a December rate cut. Theoretically.the market's direct reaction to this would be: a decline in US stocks.a rise in US Treasury yields.with short-term yields rising faster than long-term yields.a significant strengthening of the US dollar.and a decline in precious metals such as gold and silver. On the other hand.if Powell's stance on a December rate cut remains unchanged.the market will continue to fluctuate based on developments in the trade situation.

2025/10/30 1:00,【Golden Ten Summary: Recent Interest Rate Views of Fed Voting Members Diverge in Three Directions】 Advocating Significant Rate Cuts 1. Fed Governor Milan: Supports a 50 basis point rate cut in October. Two more rate cuts this year sound realistic. The difference in policy views with colleagues is more based on the speed of rate cuts than the ultimate goal of rate cuts. Dovish 1. Fed Chairman Powell: Liquidity in the money market is gradually tightening.and balance sheet reduction may be nearing its end in the coming months; recent economic activity data is stronger than expected.and the downside risks to the job market are rising. Acting too slowly may suppress employment.while acting too quickly may cause the anti-inflation task to be abandoned halfway. 2. Fed Governor Waller: Supports a 25 basis point rate cut in October. Officials can gradually ease monetary policy by cutting rates by 25 basis points each time to support the weak labor market. Rate cuts are necessary.but should be done cautiously. 3. Federal Reserve Governor Bowman: Continues to expect two more rate cuts before the end of the year. As long as the labor market and other economic data develop in the direction I expect.we will continue along the path of lowering the federal funds rate. 4. Federal Reserve Governor Collins: Given the reduced risks to inflation and concerns about the labor market.further rate cuts seem prudent. and another 25 basis point cut might be appropriate. 5. Federal Reserve Governor Williams: Supports further rate cuts this year.despite inflation having deviated from the central bank's 2% target in recent months. Rate cuts are to prevent the labor market from further widening. Hawkish: 1. Federal Reserve Vice Chairman Jefferson: Inflation and employment targets are at risk.caution is needed. 2. Federal Reserve Governor Barr: The Fed should be cautious about further rate cuts; current interest rates are moderately restrictive.tariffs pose risks to inflation.and the generally balanced labor market has potential vulnerabilities. 3. 1. Fed's Mossalaim: Skeptical of further rate cuts. He supports a 25 basis point rate cut in September due to increased risks in the labor market.but further cuts could indicate excessive complacency regarding price increases.as inflation is nearly one percentage point above the Fed's 2% target. 2. Fed's Schmid: Inclined towards no further rate cuts. He believes the Fed should continue to monitor the risk of excessive inflation as it seeks to balance the risks of overly tight or overly loose policy. 3. Fed's Goolsby: Cautious about large rate cuts ahead of schedule.not expecting inflation to subside on its own. He sees both sides of the Fed's dual mandate deteriorating. (Fed Governor Cook did not speak publicly after the September meeting. If both opposing opinions emerge.it would be the first time since the September 2019 Fed meeting.)

Interest Rate Decision: The Fed is expected to cut interest rates by 25 basis points to 3.75%-4.00% at this meeting.marking the second consecutive rate cut. 2. Voting Ratio: A three-way split is possible—most officials are expected to support a 25 basis point rate cut; Governor Milan may continue to support a 50 basis point rate cut; a minority of officials may support maintaining the current rate. (This is the first meeting since the September 2019 Fed meeting with two opposing opinions.) 3. Balance Sheet Reduction Pace: The Fed will announce the end of balance sheet reduction.or provide clear guidance on ending it (currently.it involves reducing holdings of US Treasury bonds by $5 billion and MBS by $35 billion per month). 4. Other key points: The wording in the first two paragraphs may be adjusted to acknowledge a recovery in economic activity; the statements on employment and inflation will remain largely unchanged.but the phrase increased somewhat regarding inflation may be removed; an explanation of the data gaps caused by the government shutdown may be added; the wording regarding risk balance or forward guidance may remain unchanged. Powell's press conference: 1. Policy path guidance: He may describe this rate cut as a risk management measure.likely avoiding any hints about the policy stance at the December meeting; he may also refer to the September dot plot.implying another rate cut in December. 2. Signals of ending balance sheet reduction: He may release a strong signal that balance sheet reduction is about to end.or even announce its end directly. 3. Interpretation of economic data: He may explain how decisions were made given the lack of official data during the government shutdown.or mention reliance on high-frequency substitute indicators and business surveys. 4. Inflation situation assessment: He may emphasize that core inflation remains above target.but may stress that long-term inflation expectations are stable and recent data is below expectations. 5. Assessment of the labor market: He may emphasize concerns about a cooling labor market.considering it the main reason supporting this rate cut.

The agency pointed out that although most of the impact is temporary (a short-term economic rebound is expected in the first quarter of next year).depending on the duration of the shutdown.it is estimated that $7 billion to $14 billion of GDP will be permanently lost. The report released on Wednesday shows that the government shutdown has already determined to reduce fourth-quarter GDP growth by at least 1 percentage point. If the shutdown continues into the sixth week (mid-November).real GDP growth will decrease by 1.5 percentage points (equivalent to $28 billion); if it continues into the eighth week (around Thanksgiving).the losses will expand to 2 percentage points (approximately $39 billion).
2025/10/30 1:51,[Market Analysis: The biggest risk of this interest rate meeting lies in Powell's hint that a December rate cut is not a certainty] Jinshi Data.October 30th - Adam Button.Head of ForexLive FX Strategy.stated that the market has fully priced in today's rate cut expectation as the Federal Reserve is about to announce its interest rate decision. What will happen next is less clear.but the market expects a total of 112.7 basis points of rate cuts by December (including today). Despite record highs in the stock market and easing trade tensions.the federal funds futures curve has still shifted downwards over the past month. The risk today is that Powell may hint that a December rate cut is not as certain as the market prices a 94% probability.but rather a 50/50 situation. They may convey this signal by expressing a more optimistic view of the employment situation. However.my guess is that he will maintain flexibility in his options until government data resumes being released.

2025/10/30 2:54,Federal Reserve Chairman Powell: We have not seen excessive tightness in the labor market or changes in inflation expectations.factors that could lead to a sustained rise in inflation.
2025/10/30 2:54,Federal Reserve Chairman Powell: The job market is still cooling because policy is restrictive.
2025/10/30 2:54,Federal Reserve Chairman Powell: This is a credible commitment.

2025/10/30 2:54,Federal Reserve Chairman Powell: I do not believe tariffs will be a one-off inflation shock.
2025/10/30 2:55,Federal Reserve Chairman Powell: Excluding the impact of tariffs.inflation is likely to be only 0.5% to 0.6% higher than the 2% target.

2025/10/30 3:02,Federal Reserve Chairman Powell: Normally.the labor market is a better indicator than spending; but in this case.this indicator appears more pessimistic.
2025/10/30 3:02,Federal Reserve Chairman Powell: All members of the committee are firmly committed to achieving the goals.but there are differences on how to achieve them.

2025/10/30 3:03,Federal Reserve Chairman Powell: FOMC members are divided due to forecasts and risk aversion.

2025/10/30 3:06,Federal Reserve Chairman Powell: Interest rates are not yet in an accommodative range.but they are certainly much more accommodative than before.
2025/10/30 3:06,Federal Reserve Chairman Powell: Tariffs will take some time to be passed on to consumers.
2025/10/30 3:07,Federal Reserve Chairman Powell: The easing of interest rate tightening should help protect the labor market and prevent further weakness.
2025/10/30 3:07,Federal Reserve Chairman Powell: The base case is that additional tariffs will lead to inflation.
2025/10/30 3:07,Federal Reserve Chairman Powell: Zero-job growth equilibrium is a rather delicate balance.
2025/10/30 3:08,Federal Reserve Chairman Powell: Tariffs may cause inflation to rise by another 0.2.0.3.or 0.4 percentage points.but this should be a one-off impact.
2025/10/30 3:09,Federal Reserve Chairman Powell: We will not judge an asset as wrong based solely on its price.
2025/10/30 3:09,Federal Reserve Chairman Powell: Overall.household finances are in good shape.

2025/10/30 3:10,Federal Reserve Chairman Powell: Interest rates are not a key factor in data center investment decisions.
2025/10/30 3:10,Federal Reserve Chairman Powell: Rate cuts will marginally support demand and employment.which is why we are doing this.

Powell stated.We have very different views on how to act in December. He emphasized that a December rate cut should not be seen as a done deal. In fact.far from it. This goes beyond their usual disclaimer.that policy does not proceed along a predetermined path. and is clearly an effort to regain some policy flexibility to avoid being forced to take a specific action. What if there is no government data to help clarify the economic situation? Powell pointed out that this means there is a very high degree of uncertainty. which could be a reason for cautious action.

2025/10/30 3:13,Federal Reserve Chairman Powell: Investment in artificial intelligence is clearly one of the important sources of growth.
2025/10/30 3:13,Federal Reserve Chairman Powell: Consumer spending outweighs investment in artificial intelligence.
2025/10/30 3:14,Federal Reserve Chairman Powell: There are some signs of a slowdown in the economy.with economic growth expected to be around 1.6% this year.lower than last year's level.

Therefore.Fed Chairman Powell's remarks regarding the December meeting brought a hawkish signal.which could push the dollar stronger. This doesn't mean we completely rule out policy action in December.but it will depend on the data.which is currently scarce. This caused the euro to fall below 1.16 against the dollar.and this price movement well summarizes the risks faced by dollar bears looking ahead to 2026: the anticipated narrative of 'a weaker dollar and lower yields' must be validated by economic data.

Powell has always been adept at getting the FOMC to reach a consensus (except in Milan) and seems willing to compromise on communication language in exchange for majority support. I think that as Powell's term nears its end and the Fed's responsibilities are increasingly being stretched thin.we may see more similar situations occur.'

Now there is a growing consensus that perhaps we should at least wait one cycle.

Statement Overview: Rate cut of 25 basis points to 3.75%-4.00%.the second consecutive rate cut at the meeting; Milan supported a 50 basis point rate cut; Schmid supported keeping the rate unchanged. 2. End of Balance Sheet Reduction: Balance sheet reduction will end on December 1.after which the principal from the redemption of mortgage-backed securities will be reinvested in short-term Treasury securities. 3. Labor Market: Job growth has slowed this year.and the unemployment rate has risen slightly.but remained at a low level as of August. 4. Inflation Outlook: Inflation has risen since the beginning of the year and remains at a relatively high level.not significantly different from previous statements. 5. Economic Outlook: Economic activity is expanding at a moderate pace.previously stated as economic activity slowed in the first half of the year. 6. Government Shutdown: Due to the lack of data caused by the government shutdown.the wording at the beginning of the statement was changed from existing indicators to available indicators. Powell's Press Conference: 1. Interest Rate Outlook: This rate cut is similar to the risk-management rate cut in September. A December rate cut is far from a certainty.and the lack of economic data may provide a reason to pause rate adjustments. If information is lacking and the situation remains unchanged.there are reasons to slow the pace of rate cuts. The committee is seriously divided on how to act in December. More and more officials want to postpone the rate cut.believing that at least one cycle should be waited for. 2. Government Shutdown: The government shutdown cuts off sources of economic data.but existing data suggests that the outlook has not changed much. Private data is referenced.but it cannot replace official data. 3. Inflation Outlook: Inflation levels remain slightly High.recent inflation expectations have risen.and long-term expectations are solid. Excluding tariffs.core PCE is likely to be 2.3% or 2.4%.and inflation is not far from the 2% target. 4. Job Market: State unemployment claims data send a business as usual signal.and the labor market appears to be gradually cooling. Excluding duplicates from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.job growth is almost zero. 5. Economic Outlook: Current data indicates moderate economic expansion.with an estimated growth rate of around 1.6% this year. Rising default rates do not foreshadow broader credit problems; the credit market should be closely monitored. 6. Ending Balance Sheet Reduction: Significant pressure is emerging in the money market.necessitating an immediate halt to quantitative tightening. Bank reserves are only slightly above adequate levels.requiring advance buffering. 7. Tariff Impact: Tariffs could lead to a further increase in inflation by 0.2.0.3.or 0.4 percentage points; the base case is that the impact of tariffs will be temporary. 8. Stock Market and AI: (When asked about high stock market valuations) Focusing on any single asset is not our responsibility. Artificial intelligence is different from the bubble of the 1990s; companies are already profitable. 9. Market Reaction: Upon the release of the statement.various assets fluctuated before stabilizing. After Powell mentioned a December rate cut.risk assets declined across the board.with US Treasury yields and the dollar rising. The two-year US Treasury yield rose 10 basis points intraday.and gold fell $40. 10. Latest Forecasts: As of press time.the market expects a 65% probability of a Fed rate cut in December.compared to 83% before the meeting. The expected interest rate by the end of next year has risen 4 basis points to 3.04%.
2025/10/30 3:52,The yield on the 2-year U.S. Treasury note continued to rise.increasing by 11 basis points to break through the 3.6% mark.currently trading at 3.612%.

Powell's statement reflects the tension within the Federal Reserve regarding further rate cuts.especially given that inflation remains high and exceeds the Fed's own target. Investors should expect inflation to remain high for an extended period.which will limit the extent of further monetary easing. The stock market retreated as investors had anticipated a boost from further rate cuts. However.this is only a temporary reaction. Ultimately.corporate earnings will drive the stock market.and earnings performance remains strong.therefore we remain fully invested in our portfolio.

This indicates that the view within the Fed supporting a pause in rate cuts is gaining momentum. Looking ahead.although the Fed still has some room for easing.the pace of rate cuts may slow down.and overly optimistic expectations are not advisable. At the same time.the stimulus effect of this round of rate cuts may be weaker than in previous cycles.partly due to a significant weakening of the refinancing effect. The Fed also announced that it will end quantitative tightening (QT) in December.which we believe is more of a technical consideration and should not be over-interpreted; with significant room for further reductions in policy rates.the need to purchase unconventional financial assets is not significant.
2025/10/30 8:09,[CICC: Calculations show the Fed still has room for 3 more rate cuts; the new Fed chairman is the biggest variable in the interest rate path] According to a CICC research report on October 30th.under the natural scenario. they calculate that the Fed still has room for 3 more rate cuts in this round.corresponding to long-term interest rates of 3.8-4.0%. Currently.the difference between the US real interest rate and the natural interest rate is 0.8%. Three more rate cuts of 25bp each would bring financing costs and investment returns even out. corresponding to a nominal neutral interest rate of 3.5%. Assuming a term premium of 30-50bp.this corresponds to a 10-year US Treasury yield of 3.8-4.0%. The short-term rate cut path will depend more on the government shutdown and data.such as when the shutdown will be resolved to release new employment data.

Powell's assessment of the economic situation is similar to that of September.and regarding the significant disagreement within the FOMC about whether to continue cutting rates in December.he indicated that a December rate cut is not a certainty. However.we believe that not cutting rates in December requires the US government to return to normal operations and release economic data that does not support further rate cuts.which is a higher threshold than continuing rate cuts. Furthermore.we believe that among the current 12 voting members for 2025.the number supporting a December rate cut is still greater.and we expect December to be a closed rate cut. We maintain our previous view that the Federal Reserve will cut rates by another 25 basis points at its next policy meeting. Following Powell's downplaying of rate cut expectations.the dollar and Treasury yields rose.while US stocks and gold suffered some setbacks. We expect the market to continue trading on this shift in the short term.with expectations of a rate cut being reduced.

This contrasts with the Federal Reserve's 25 basis point rate cut to support the US job market while preventing a rebound in inflation. For the ECB.maintaining the current rate seems more reasonable.

This means that even if the ECB wanted to cut interest rates further.it wouldn't need to worry too much about a significant currency depreciation. Despite the impact of large-scale US tariffs.the Eurozone economy has remained resilient. Data released on Thursday showed that Eurozone GDP grew by 1.3% year-on-year in the third quarter.slightly higher than economists' expectations.
