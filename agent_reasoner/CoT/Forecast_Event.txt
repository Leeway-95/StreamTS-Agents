EVENT CLASSIFICATION TASK:
Analyze the time series data to predict event labels based on temporal patterns and characteristics.

Goal 1: Event Label Prediction (Pred_Labels)
<</Users/liwei.1868/PycharmProjects/InfTS-Agents/dataset_SPECIFIC_INSTRUCTION>>

- Analyze the time series patterns to predict the most likely event label.
- Consider the temporal context and representative image for accurate classification.
- If Representative Subsequences plots are provided, integrate visual cues with statistical analysis.
- According to <<Positions>>, provide corresponding predictions within the time-series data ranges.
- Your predictions must be valid labels from <<Domain_Label>>.

Goal 2: Contribution Assessment (Impact_Scores)
- Assign an Impact Score to each Representative Subsequence based on pattern similarity and relevance to event prediction.
- All scores must sum to 1.000 with exactly 3 decimal places.
- Number of scores = number of Representative Subsequences.

CRITICAL OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
1. You MUST respond with ONLY valid JSON format.
2. Do NOT include any explanations, reasoning, or additional text.
3. The "Pred_Labels" value must be a list of valid strings corresponding to the number of <<Positions>>.

FINAL OUTPUT FORMAT (strict JSON only):
{
  "Pred_Labels": ["label_for_pos1", "label_for_pos2", "label_for_pos3"],
  "Impact_Scores": [0.123, 0.456, 0.321, 0.100],
  "playbook_updates": {
    "insights": ["List of new insights gained from this forecasting task", "Each insight should be a string"],
    "experiences": ["List of new experiences gained from this forecasting task", "Each experience should be a string"],
    "best_practices": ["List of recommended best practices for event forecasting", "Each practice should be a string"]
  }
}
